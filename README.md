# DynamoQL

DynamoQL emerges as a response to the growing complexity of managing DynamoDB tables, a task that can quickly become challenging as an application scales. Maintaining a DynamoDB database, while powerful, can pose significant challenges, especially when schemas evolve. DynamoQL positions itself as a solution to alleviate the cognitive load on developers by providing a vastly improved development experience compared to the AWS SDK. With a strong emphasis on type checking, DynamoQL simplifies the data management process, offering a more intuitive and robust solution for developers working with DynamoDB.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install dynamoql
```

or with yarn

```bash
yarn add dynamoql
```
